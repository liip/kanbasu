![Kanbasu logo]({{ path 'logo.svg' }})

Kanbasu is a toolbox to create responsive web interfaces quickly. It’s focused on the layout and voluntarily avoid defining much “styling” properties which can be completely different from project to project.

Written is Sass, it’s highly customizable, every component being optional and customizable with variables.

CSS features used are working in all current major browsers. The oldest Internet Explorer version supported is 11. However, the framework does not include vendor-prefixed properties! When building it, we recommend you to use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to ensure a complete compatibility.

[The code](https://github.com/liip/kanbasu) is hosted on GitHub.
